Description: D-Bus message bus
 D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
 one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
 coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a
 \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and
 daemons on demand when their services are needed.

 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface
 is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one
 language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' library
 really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully

 that handles type conversions for values passed between the two
 languages.

Description: Library for manipulating C and Unicode strings
 Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of
 very different scripts from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi with many
 kinds of special characters accents, right-to-left writing marks,
 hyphens, Roman numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for
 text do not contain adequate functions for dealing with particular
 properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text
 have several assumptions at their base which don't hold for Unicode text.
 This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for
 manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.  This package
 contains documentation.

Description: XFt: X FreeType libary
 Xft was designed to provide good support for scalable fonts, and to do so
 efficiently.  Unlike the core fonts system, it supports features such as
 anti-aliasing and sub-pixel rasterisation. Perhaps more importantly, it
 gives applications full control over the way glyphs are rendered, making
 fine typesetting and WYSIWIG display possible. Finally, it allows
 applications to use fonts that are not installed system-wide for
 displaying documents with embedded fonts.  Xft is not compatible with the
 core fonts system: usage of Xft requires fairly extensive changes to
 toolkits (user-interface libraries).

 The Intrinsics are a programming library tailored to the special
 requirements of user interface construction within a network window
 system, specifically the X Window System. The Intrinsics and a widget set
 make up an X Toolkit. The Intrinsics provide the base mechanism necessary
 to build a wide variety of interoperating widget sets and application
 environments. The Intrinsics are a layer on top of Xlib, the C Library X
 Interface. They extend the fundamental abstractions provided by the X
 Window System while still remaining independent of any particular user
 interface policy or style.

Description: Userspace framebuffer boot logo based on usplash
 PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly embedded
 Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It has few
 dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and handles
 rotation. Its visual look is configurable by basic source changes. Also
 included is a 'client' command utility for sending information to psplash
 such as boot progress information.

Description: A System and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV
 and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
 capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
 offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
 maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
 transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
